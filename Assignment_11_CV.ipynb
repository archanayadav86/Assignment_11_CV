    "Ans-->Non Maximum Suppression is a computer vision method that selects a single entity out of many overlapping entities (for example bounding boxes in object detection). The criteria is usually discarding entities that are below a given probability bound.It  is a technique used in numerous computer vision tasks. It is a class of algorithms to select one entity out of many overlapping entities. We can choose the selection criteria to arrive at the desired results"

So if a video is captured and played back at 24fps, that means each second of video shows 24 distinct still images.It defines how fast your object detection model process your video and generates the desired output. The first step for any custom object detection is to grab images for labeling."

    "It is a multi-stage model, where each stage is an independent component. Thus, it cannot be trained end-to-end. It caches the extracted features from the pre-trained CNN on the disk to later train the SVMs."
